# OpenGraph & Twitter Card Images

These static images are used as fallbacks for social media sharing in case the dynamically generated images don't work properly.

- `opengraph-image.png` - For Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc.
- `twitter-image.png` - For Twitter sharing
- `de-opengraph-image.png` - German version for Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, etc.
- `de-twitter-image.png` - German version for Twitter sharing

Note: These should ideally be replaced with dynamically generated images using the Next.js Edge Runtime when possible.
