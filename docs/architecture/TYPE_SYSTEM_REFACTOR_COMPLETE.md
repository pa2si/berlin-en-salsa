# Type System Refactor - Complete ✅

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Branch:** `fixes-after-refactor`

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive type system refactor that separates Raw (pre-enrichment) and Enriched (post-enrichment) event types. This enforces proper type safety and makes the event enrichment process explicit in the type system.

## Problem Solved

Previously, `startTime`, `endTime`, and `day` properties were optional on all event types, even though they were required after timeline enrichment. This led to:

- Unnecessary undefined checks throughout the codebase
- Type ambiguity between raw event definitions and enriched runtime events
- Confusion about when scheduling properties were available

## Solution: Separate Raw and Enriched Types

### Type Architecture

**Raw Event Types** (Before Enrichment):

```typescript
// Base definition without scheduling
interface BaseEventDefinition {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  title: string;
  area: AreaType;
  // NO startTime, endTime, or day
}

// Specific raw event types
- RawMainStageEvent
- RawDanceWorkshopEvent
- RawMusicWorkshopEvent
- RawTalkEvent
- RawAviatrixTalkEvent
- RawDanceShowEvent

// Union type
type RawTimetableEvent = RawMainStageEvent | RawDanceWorkshopEvent | ...
```

**Enriched Event Types** (After Enrichment):

```typescript
// Scheduling information added during enrichment
interface SchedulingInfo {
  startTime: string;    // Required
  endTime: string;      // Required
  day: "saturday" | "sunday";  // Required
}

// Base event with scheduling
interface BaseEvent extends BaseEventDefinition, SchedulingInfo {}

// Specific enriched event types
- MainStageEvent extends BaseEvent
- DanceWorkshopEvent extends BaseEvent (with required duration)
- MusicWorkshopEvent extends BaseEvent (with required duration)
- TalkEvent extends BaseEvent
- AviatrixTalkEvent extends BaseEvent
- DanceShowEvent extends BaseEvent

// Union type
type TimetableEvent = MainStageEvent | DanceWorkshopEvent | ...
```

## Files Changed

### 1. Type Definitions (`/src/types/events.ts`)

- ✅ Added `BaseEventDefinition` interface (raw)
- ✅ Added `SchedulingInfo` interface
- ✅ Created all 6 Raw event type interfaces
- ✅ Created `RawTimetableEvent` union type
- ✅ Made `duration` required in enriched workshop types
- ✅ Separated raw from enriched event types with proper inheritance

### 2. Event Factory (`/src/utils/eventFactory.ts`)

- ✅ Updated all factory method return types to Raw versions:
  - `createMainStageEvent()` → returns `RawMainStageEvent`
  - `createDanceWorkshop()` → returns `RawDanceWorkshopEvent`
  - `createMusicWorkshop()` → returns `RawMusicWorkshopEvent`
  - `createTalk()` → returns `RawTalkEvent`
  - `createAviatrixTalk()` → returns `RawAviatrixTalkEvent`
  - `createDanceShow()` → returns `RawDanceShowEvent`
- ✅ Added `TimetableEvent` import back for `EventUtils` methods

### 3. Event Definition Files

- ✅ `dance-workshops.ts`: Changed to `RawDanceWorkshopEvent[]`
- ✅ `music-workshops.ts`: Changed to `RawMusicWorkshopEvent[]`
- ✅ `main-stage.ts`: Changed to `RawTimetableEvent[]`
- ✅ `salsa-talks.ts`: Changed to `RawTimetableEvent[]`

### 4. Timeline Configuration (`/src/utils/timelineConfig.ts`)

- ✅ `createTimelineFromSimpleConfig()`:
  - Accepts `RawTimetableEvent[]` as input
  - Returns `TimetableEvent[]` as output
  - Adds required `startTime`, `endTime`, `day` properties
  - Adds `duration` for workshop events
- ✅ `generateTimeSlotsFromTimeline()`:
  - Accepts `RawTimetableEvent[]` and `day` parameter
  - Returns enriched `TimetableEvent[]` in time slots
  - Properly enriches events with all required scheduling fields
- ✅ Updated all convenience functions to pass day parameter

## Data Flow

```
1. EVENT DEFINITION (Raw)
   └─> EventFactory.createDanceWorkshop()
       └─> Returns: RawDanceWorkshopEvent
           (NO startTime, endTime, day, or duration)

2. COLLECTION (Raw)
   └─> export const danceWorkshopEvents: RawDanceWorkshopEvent[]

3. TIMELINE CONFIG
   └─> Timeline slots define: { time, duration, eventId }

4. ENRICHMENT (Raw → Enriched)
   └─> createTimelineFromSimpleConfig(slots, rawEvents, day)
       └─> Returns: TimetableEvent[]
           (WITH startTime, endTime, day, duration)

5. RUNTIME (Enriched)
   └─> Components receive: TimetableEvent
       └─> All scheduling properties guaranteed present
```

## Benefits

### Type Safety

✅ Compiler enforces the enrichment process  
✅ No optional properties that should be required  
✅ Clear separation between definition and runtime phases  
✅ Type guards work correctly at each stage

### Developer Experience

✅ No unnecessary undefined checks in components  
✅ Clear intent: Raw events are defined, then enriched  
✅ Timeline config is explicit about scheduling  
✅ Factory methods can't accidentally create invalid events

### Maintainability

✅ Enrichment logic centralized in timeline functions  
✅ Event definitions remain clean and focused  
✅ Type system documents the data transformation  
✅ Easier to add new event types following the pattern

## Build Status

✅ **TypeScript Compilation**: PASSED  
✅ **Linting**: PASSED  
✅ **Type Validation**: PASSED  
✅ **Production Build**: SUCCESSFUL

```
Route (app)                                 Size  First Load JS
├ ● /[locale]                            16.1 kB         181 kB
├ ● /[locale]/timetable                  9.62 kB         170 kB
└ ... all routes built successfully
```

## Key Insights

1. **Timeline as Source of Truth**: The timeline configuration determines when events appear, not the events themselves
2. **Type Transformation**: Raw → Enriched transformation is now explicit in the type system
3. **Required Properties**: Workshop duration is now required after enrichment (not optional)
4. **Day Independence**: Events are day-agnostic; the timeline assigns them to Saturday or Sunday

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the application manually
2. Consider deleting old Saturday/Sunday split files if no longer needed
3. Update documentation for new contributors about the Raw/Enriched pattern
4. Monitor for any runtime issues during testing
