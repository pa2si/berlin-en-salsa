## 🎯 Components to Modify

### High-Priority Changes (Required)

1. **TimetableService** (`src/data/timetable/services/timetable.service.ts`)
   - Status: Needs new methods to return events directly
   - Risk: Low (adding alongside existing)

2. **TimetablePage** (`src/app/[locale]/timetable/page.tsx`)
   - Status: Needs to call new service methods
   - Risk: Low (server component)

3. **TimetableClient** (`src/components/timetable/TimetableClient.tsx`)
   - Status: Needs to accept events instead of columns
   - Risk: Medium (client component, state management)

4. **TimetableGrid** (`src/components/timetable/TimetableGrid.tsx`)
   - Status: Needs to pass events to columns
   - Risk: Medium (rendering logic)

5. **AreaColumn** (`src/components/timetable/AreaColumn.tsx`)
   - Status: Needs to render from events
   - Risk: Medium (might not exist as separate component)

6. **TimeSlot** (`src/components/timetable/TimeSlot.tsx`)
   - Status: Currently builds SelectedEventDetails
   - Risk: High (complex logic, needs simplification)

### Low-Priority Changes (Cleanup)

7. **EventModal directory** (`src/components/timetable/EventModal/`)
   - Status: Will be deleted after NewEventModal is integrated
   - Files: EventModal.tsx, EventDetails.tsx, EventNavigation.tsx, EventSlider.tsx

8. **useEventModal hook** (`src/components/timetable/hooks/useEventModal.ts`)
   - Status: Can be simplified or replaced

9. **Translation utilities** (`src/data/timetable/utils/timetableTranslation.ts`)
   - Status: Check if still needed after bridge removal

## 📊 Code Metrics

### Lines to Remove
- `convertNewEventsToTranslatableTimeSlots()`: ~300 lines
- `TranslatableTimeSlot` types: ~80 lines
- EventModal directory: ~341 lines (EventModal.tsx)
- Related utility functions: ~100 lines
- **Total**: ~821 lines of legacy code

### Lines to Add
- New service methods: ~50-100 lines
- Updated component props: ~50 lines
- Simplified TimeSlot: ~50 lines (net reduction)
- **Total**: ~150-200 lines

### Net Reduction
- **Expected**: ~621-671 lines removed
- **Architecture**: Much simpler, more maintainable

## ⚠️ Known Risks

### 1. Translation System (Medium Risk)
**Issue**: NewEventModal uses different translation approach than old system
**Mitigation**: Test in all 3 languages (EN, DE, ES) before finalizing
**Fallback**: Can adjust translation keys if needed

### 2. Event Continuation Logic (Medium Risk)
**Issue**: Current system handles multi-slot events with `isContinuation` flag
**Mitigation**: Verify this logic is preserved when rendering from events
**Fallback**: Can recreate in new format

### 3. Modal Feature Parity (High Risk)
**Issue**: Old EventModal might have features NewEventModal doesn't
**Mitigation**: Side-by-side comparison before switching
**Fallback**: Keep old modal code until verified

### 4. Slide System (Medium Risk)
**Issue**: Complex slide data structures in old system
**Mitigation**: Test all slide variations (DJs, dancers, talks)
**Fallback**: Can add compatibility layer if needed

## 🧪 Manual Testing Plan

### Before Starting Migration

Test current system:
1. [ ] Navigate to `/timetable`
2. [ ] Switch between Saturday and Sunday
3. [ ] Click on various event types:
   - [ ] DJ set (main-stage)
   - [ ] Live band (main-stage)
   - [ ] Dance workshop
   - [ ] Music workshop
   - [ ] Regular talk
   - [ ] Aviatrix talk
4. [ ] Verify modal features:
   - [ ] Images load
   - [ ] Descriptions display
   - [ ] Bios show
   - [ ] Slides navigate
   - [ ] Close works (X button, ESC, click outside)
5. [ ] Test translations:
   - [ ] Switch to German
   - [ ] Switch to Spanish
   - [ ] Verify all text translates

### After Each Migration Step

1. [ ] Run `npm run build` (or dev server)
2. [ ] Check console for errors
3. [ ] Verify TypeScript compilation
4. [ ] Test affected feature
5. [ ] Compare with baseline

### Before Final Cleanup

1. [ ] Full regression test (all items above)
2. [ ] Visual comparison with screenshots
3. [ ] Performance check (page load time)
4. [ ] Mobile responsive test
